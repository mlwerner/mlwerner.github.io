            <p>Bert and Ernie came to the Werner household at the very start of the 2020 Covid-pandemic. Though the family went planning on getting one, they could not choose, and thus we have ‘the boys.’ Raised by the children of the house, the puppies provided the family a gift that cannot be put into words during times of such turmoil and isolation. They are loved immensely.

        <h3>About the Breed</h3>
        <p>Bert and Ernie are miniature aussiedoodles. This breed is a cross 
            between a miniature Australian Shepherd and a miniature Poodle. This 
            cross-breed was created following the popularity of the Labradoodle - 
            a lab and poodle mix. Both of these breeds are hypoallergenic and adorable.
            <br><br>
            Miniature aussiedoodles, in particular, are known for their immense intelligence. 
            Both the poodle and the australian shepherd are very smart breeds. The poodle is a smart, athletic, 
            and noble breed. The australian shepherd, on the other hand, is a herding dog and equally intelligent 
            and athletic.
            <br><br>
            Owners are encouraged to beware of the breed, though, for their high energy. 
            This breed is also an expensive breed as they are considered pedigree animals. 
            The breed is further broken down by generation, which corresponds to whether they 
            are direct descendants of a poodle and aussie, or an aussiedoodle with another aussiedoodle,
             poodle, or aussie.
