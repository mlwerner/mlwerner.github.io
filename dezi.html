            <p>Dezi came to join the Werner family in 2012. Born on Christmas Eve, her full name is December but no one calls her that. At the age of 3, Dezi developed severe hip-dysplasia and had to undergoe an intense hip replacement surgery. Luckily, she was able to make a full recovery and can now frolick freely outdoors all day long - as she loves to do.
                 She often spends her time running back and forth across
                 the lawn, as if herding the cars that pass off her property (she is very good at it).

        <h3>About the Breed</h3>
        <p>To many, Border Collies are considered the smartest breed of dog.
            Bred for herding sheep, they are extraordinarily energetic and have
            an intense drive to work. To many owners unaware of this aspect of the breed,
            the Border Collie can be overwhelming, as they need to release their energy
            each and every day.
            <br><br>
            Border Collies can look very different, though they often grow to be 
            a medium sized dog at about 30-55 pounds and live anywhere from 12 to 15
            years. They can also have different coats - rough or smooth, black and white,
            brown and white, tri-color, and more.
            <br><br>
            Border collies are extraordinarily intelligent, loving, and energetic, though owners
            should know what they are getting themselves into before deciding to getting
            a Border Collie.
