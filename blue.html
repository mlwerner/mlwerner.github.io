            <p>Blue joined the family in the summer of 2018. Though she was said to be a husky-german shepard mix, which was mostly true, but a 23-and-me test revealed she is also 9/9 on the “wolf-like” scale for dogs. Not surprising as she has eaten many birds in her lifetime. A singing dog with lots of personality, Blue is one of a kind and she knows it.

        <h3>About the Breed</h3>
        <p>It is a bit difficult to categorize Blue in a single breed, 
            as she is a Husky-German Shepherd mix, with a bit of Lab springkled 
            in there somewhere. However, as she looks most like a Husky, we will start there. 
            The Siberian Husky is a breed designed to pull sleds behind them in artic climates - 
            clearly not the North Carolina weather that Blue is subjected to. The breed is known to
            be friendly and to get along well with other dogs. Many owners, however, find the Dogs 
            to be quite sassy and, though lovely, disobedient at times.
            <br><br>
            As for the German Shepherd, they are considered one of the best working dog breeds. 
            In addition, the breed is thought to be extraordinarily loyal and courageous. 
            The Werner's will tell you that though Blue might be loyal, she most definitely is NOT 
            courageous or obedient.
            <br><br>
            Neither of these breeds, however, truly encapsulates Blue as a dog. One thing does.
             When Blue first came to the family they did a doggy-DNA test on her to understand what 
             she truly was. The results included a scale of how "wolf-like" your dog is, and Blue 
             managed to secure a whopping 9 out of 9. She is not Husky nor German Shepherd - she is wolf.
